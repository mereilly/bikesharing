# Bikesharing

## Background
Inspired by a the citibike program in NYC, my friend, Kate, and I decided lets look into bringing a bikesharing business to Des Moines ("DM BiikeShare"). 

You know that you want to use Tableau to create effective visualizations from the Citi Bike data, which Kate can then use to impress potential investors. You also know that the key to getting a good visualization—and, really, any good data analysis—is to start with a question. But what is the right question to ask and how do you portray the answer accurately?


## Summary with Visuals
The key takeaways from this analysis are that males make up far more of Citibike's rider base than females, Subscribers to Citibike make up a larger number of users than Customers, and usage tends to peak around and shortly after commuting hours.

Two additional analyses that could be helpful are average distance of rides and usage heatmaps for a subregion of New York that is more similar to Des Moines than the city as a whole.


 
"Subscribers"(orange) refers to annual subscribers of the bike-sharing service, while "customers" (blue) are the short-term riders:
