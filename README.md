# Bikesharing

## Background and Purpose
Inspired by a the citibike program in NYC, my friend, Kate, and I decided lets look into bringing a bikesharing business to Des Moines ("DM BiikeShare"). Kate and I made this project for a presentation for an in-person pitch with potential investors. Here I made visualizations to help make apparent our plan based on observations from NYC that we think we could translate to Des Moines.

## Results:
Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
Two more visualizations I would preform would be focused around the idea of maintainence.

## Comments on Visualizations and added Other Visuals left out of the dashboard

The key takeaways from this analysis are that males make up far more of Citibike's rider base than females, Subscribers to Citibike make up a larger number of users than Customers, and usage tends to peak around and shortly after commuting hours.

Two additional analyses that could be helpful are average distance of rides and usage heatmaps for a subregion of New York that is more similar to Des Moines than the city as a whole.

Number of trips total collected in this dataset: 2 344 244 
 
"Subscribers"(orange) refers to annual subscribers of the bike-sharing service, while "customers" (blue) are the short-term riders:
