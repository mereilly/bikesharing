Bikesharing

Background and Purpose

Inspired by a the citibike program in NYC, my friend, Kate, and I decided lets look into bringing a bikesharing business to Des Moines ("DM BiikeShare"). Kate and I made this project for a presentation for an in-person pitch with potential investors. Here I made visualizations to help make apparent our plan based on observations from NYC that we think we could translate to Des Moines.

Results:

If you first focus on the trend line for users at large in "Checkout Times for Users," we get an interestingn notion that users checkout for under an hour, meaning that the bikes could circulate and wouldn't get hogged. It would be important to focus our attention to "Trips by Weekday for Each Hour" now, first looking at it without yet filtering per female or male. Here we see that a higher demand and use of those short trips would probably continue to take place between 1600 and 1900 and to a lesser extend at 0800. This seems to align with work schedules during the week, it suggests that some people may use this as a mode to get to work in the mornings, and then back but a good ammount of people would also use them recreationally after work given they didn't use it in the morning. Now if we focus our attention to "Gender by Weekday" we see the male column has much darker hues, especially amongst annually subscribers, meaning that they areusing thes bikesfreaquently and relying on them potentially because of work schedules and allowed attire which is easier to get on bikes with. It is interesting that Thursday is particularly a day that these male subscriber tend to use the bikes, and worth invesitgating. Now let's turn our attention to Check out times again, expect this time, let's look at "CheckoutTImes by Gennder," here it is ever more clear that the greatest contributor to thesse short trips being popular are the male users. So let's pair this finding with the "Total Users by Gender" barchart where unfiltered version makes it clear that men are far greator in the user proportion, but then if filtered to subscribers, we can see that the difference between the genders isn't that drastic and over 200K women do annually subscribe, they simply are not using that subscription actively - which from a capitalistic point of view could even be in the investors interest (people paying for a service without contributing to wearing out the bikes).

Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

Two more visualizations I would preform would be focused around the idea of maintainence and the ammount of time it takes to preform maintainance to see if our two hour window is enought, and then I'd like to look at the start and stop population locations overlayed with census data for gender groups, to show investors if there are a good ammount of men to take up this project based on these trends from NYC. Still, Kate and I are women, and I'd like to investigate what is contributing to less women being encouraged to use bikes and maybe even propose to the investors that we could be on the cuttting edge in designing a more inclusive program.

Comments on Visualizations and added Other Visuals left out of the dashboard

Two additional analyses that could be helpful are average distance of rides and usage heatmaps for a subregion of New York that is more similar to Des Moines than the city as a whole.

Number of trips total collected in this dataset: 2 344 244

"Subscribers"(orange) refers to annual subscribers of the bike-sharing service, while "customers" (blue) are the short-term riders: Screen Shot 2021-10-16 at 6 40 08 PM
