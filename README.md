# Bikesharing


## Background
Inspired by a the citibike program in NYC, my friend, Kate, and I decided lets look into bringing a bikesharing business to Des Moines ("DM BiikeShare"). 

<!-- You know that you want to use Tableau to create effective visualizations from the Citi Bike data, which Kate can then use to impress potential investors. You also know that the key to getting a good visualization—and, really, any good data analysis—is to start with a question. But what is the right question to ask and how do you portray the answer accurately?
 bike maintenance will likely be one of the biggest expenses. So, what can the data tell us about the upkeep bikes might need?
 
 Kate calls you with exciting news: the potential investors have agreed to an in-person pitch!! You quickly review your findings and decide they aren't quite polished enough for a full-fledged, real-time, big-deal pitch. You want to put something together that both eloquently answers investors' questions and that really pops. So it's on to the next Tableau tool: dashboards. -->


<!-- Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender. -->

## Comments on Visualizations and added Other Visuals left out of the dashboard

The key takeaways from this analysis are that males make up far more of Citibike's rider base than females, Subscribers to Citibike make up a larger number of users than Customers, and usage tends to peak around and shortly after commuting hours.

Two additional analyses that could be helpful are average distance of rides and usage heatmaps for a subregion of New York that is more similar to Des Moines than the city as a whole.

Number of trips total collected in this dataset: 2 344 244 
 
"Subscribers"(orange) refers to annual subscribers of the bike-sharing service, while "customers" (blue) are the short-term riders:
